2. Direct Mails: this function lets you create a new direct mail based on a newsletter that has not yet been used to create one, or based on an external URL, or select an existing direct mail; selecting an existing direct mail leads you to a screen that lets you view the current information on the direct mail, edit the properties of the direct mail, and select from a menu of options the action you want to take on the selected direct mail.

3. Recipient Lists: this function lets you create a new recipient list, import Addresses records from csv data to create a new recipient list, link to the diting form of an existing recipient list, or select an existing recipient list; selecting an existing recipient list leads you to a screen that lets you view the number of recipients of each type in the list, with the options to list the recipients or download a csv file.

4. Mailer Engine Status: this function lets you review the current status of the direct mails that have been scheduled for mass sending, and invoke manually the mailer engine, if it is not configured to be automatically invoked; selecting one of the listed direct mails leads you to the Direct Mails function where you may select to review the statistics of the selected direct mail.

5. QuickMail: this function lets you enter a short message and send it immediately to a recipient list. No newsletter, nor any direct mail is involved in this function.

			<source><![CDATA[The records to import are entered one per line. Each record to import is a comma-separated list of field values. You may also specify the use of a semicolon(;) or of a colon (:) as separator instead of the comma.

On the first line you may enter a comma-separated list of field names. This first line provides the structure for the records that follow. If you do not provide a list of field names on the first line, then the structure of the records is assumed to be "name, email".

Each field name listed on the first line is analyzed as follows:

1.the field name may one of the field names from the following list: uid, name, title, email, phone, www, address, company, city, zip, country, fax, module_sys_dmail_html, module_sys_dmail_category;

2.the field name may be omitted in which case the corresponding values will be skipped or omitted;

3.the field name may start with "user_", assuming that table tt_address was extended with the specified field name;

4.in addition, fields may be suffixed with "[code]"; in this case, when the value in the imported record is not null, "[+value]" adds that number to the field value and "[=value]" overrides any existing value in the field.
