			<source>The records to import are entered one per line. Each record to import is a comma-separated list of field values. You may also specify the use of a semicolon(;) or of a colon (:) as separator instead of the comma.

On the first line you may enter a comma-separated list of field names. This first line provides the structure for the records that follow. If you do not provide a list of field names on the first line, then the structure of the records is assumed to be &quot;name, email&quot;.

Each field name listed on the first line is analyzed as follows:

1.the field name may one of the field names from the following list: uid, name, title, email, phone, www, address, company, city, zip, country, fax, module_sys_dmail_html, module_sys_dmail_category;

2.the field name may be omitted in which case the corresponding values will be skipped or omitted;

3.the field name may start with &quot;user_&quot;, assuming that table tt_address was extended with the specified field name;

4.in addition, fields may be suffixed with &quot;[code]&quot;; in this case, when the value in the imported record is not null, &quot;[+value]&quot; adds that number to the field value and &quot;[=value]&quot; overrides any existing value in the field.

Example of csv field specification:
;user_date;name;email;zip;phone;user_age[=20]
