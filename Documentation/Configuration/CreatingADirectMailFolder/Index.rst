Creating a Direct Mail folder
-----------------------------

All operations of the Direct Mail module are performed from a
specifically configured SysFolder. You may configure multiple Direct
Mail folders.

To create a Direct Mail folder:

- Create a new page somewhere in the page tree of your site.

- Choose it to be of type SysFolder (and nothing else!)

- Give it a title

- Make sure it contains plugin: Direct Mail.

Once the Direct Mail folder is created, its title should appear in the
list of available Direct Mail folders when using backend menu option
Web > Direct Mail. Clicking on the folder title should display a page
with the module drop-down function menu.
